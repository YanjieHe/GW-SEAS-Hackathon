      <td>10/10</td>
      <td>After been <a href="http://localhost:8080/getlink/1">watching tons of thousands of Hollywood science fiction</a> movies or superhero movies, I already had no interest or hope for Chinese film because of many reasons. But this one indeed blowed my mind and I just can't wait to watch it again.

    For all the years of development process that we've been counting on, Chinese film industry didn't give us that many surprises but instead a lot of messed up things such as corruption and tax evasion. Sometimes even if we had a great script, there is no way to get enough funding on the right things because all the money was paid for those "data stars". There are lots of young and pretty stars that can drive huge customer data flow on the internet, they can easily earn millions of dollars just to appear in one movie. At the same time, what they can bring to the table was totally not enough for people to say they are a good actor, or even an actor.</td>

      <th scope="row"><b>Epic Science Fiction Movie</b></th>
      <td>9/10</td>
      <td>Just watched the IMAX 3D movie. Trust me, don't do it any other way. Imagine ten of thousands of fusion thrusters are pushing our planet away from a dying sun on a IMAX screen. The visual effect is impressive and goes well with the story. The story is not everyday Hollywood style: Superhero saves the day; everyone else is there to give a round of applause. This movie brings a serious question to the audience: What are you gonna do facing an unavoidable, irresistible disaster to our civilization? All characters in the movie are ordinary people and everyone gives their answer with shining humanity. Against all the odds no one gives in without a good fight. The chance of success is close to zero but they choose hope. All the efforts add up and make impossible nothing. It is a Sci-Fi fan's feast you dont want to miss.</td>

      <th scope="row"><b>A rare gem in the field of Sci-Fi</b></th>
      <td>9/10</td>
      <td>After producing a string of sloppy, cringe-worthy sci-fi films, Chinese cinema has finally delivered one with awe-inspiring visual, and more surprisingly, a humanizing story.

        For fans of hard sci-fi, this film's premise is indeed a bit absurd and scientifically inaccurate; building ten thousand massive engines on the surface of earth to move the entire planet away from a dying sun. Still, the focus is not technology but people. The main plot focuses on grandfather, father and son (plus an adopted daughter) try to survive and preserve whatever dignity and humanity still remains on a chaotic frozen planet. The film hammers in the notion that anyone is somebody's child, parent or best friend, yet a single human life is merely an incredibly expendable resource in the bigger picture. The visual effects are total eye-candy, but a generous amount of practical effects and realistic props are constant reminders of the setting's 'earthiness'.</td>

      <th scope="row"><b>China's first big science fiction movie, so beautiful!</b></th>
      <td>9/10</td>
      <td>I am a fan of Cixin Liu's novels.And I love his "Three body problem"best. This movie is adapted from his novel of the same name.To be honest,it didn't disappoint me.I'm sure you've never seen a science fiction movie like this!The idea of running away with the planet is so crazy,but so beautiful!The film shows the Chinese people's unique feelings towards their home,family and land.And it does not display individualism like the Hollywood superhero movies, nor does it publicize any political idea, but only the courage and unwilling to be destroyed when facing a desperate situation.Although I don't like Jing Wu's "Wolf warrior", as far as his performance in "Wandering earth" is concerned, well done! I recommend you to watch it.You'll never forget it.</td>

      <th scope="row"><b>Great movie and a great point of view to know more about Chinese culture.</b></th>
      <td>10/10</td>
      <td>Well, this movie has a lot to improve for sure. But I still give it a 10/10.

    The movie actually shows lots of difference between American culture(Hollywood movie) and Chinese culture.

    For example, I'll except shelters, spaceships in Hollywood movies when Earth is no longer good for human survival. But in Chinese culture, we will never leave our home back. We will try our best and bring everyone together. Then this what we saw in the movie, we put 10000 engines on Earth and run away together, lol.</td>
